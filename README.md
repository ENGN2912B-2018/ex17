# Classroom examples from Lecture 17 - Qt

This example was build and tested using Qt Creator 4.7.2 (based on Qt 5.11.2) for OSX.  These build instructions should apply for any operating system, since Qt is designed to be cross-platform portable.  Some of these instructions may need to be modified for the Qt Creator version or operating system you are using.  Note that this project can be converted to use CMake rather than the Qt Creator Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Qt's QMake build tool.
